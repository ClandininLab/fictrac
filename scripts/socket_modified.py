    # 1       frame counter                   Corresponding video frame (starts at #1).
    # 2-4     delta rotation vector (cam)     Change in orientation since last frame,
    #                                         represented as rotation angle/axis (radians)
    #                                         in camera coordinates (x right, y down, z
    #                                         forward).
    # 5       delta rotation error score      Error score associated with rotation
    #                                         estimate.
    # 6-8     delta rotation vector (lab)     Change in orientation since last frame,
    #                                         represented as rotation angle/axis (radians)
    #                                         in laboratory coordinates (see
    #                                         *configImg.jpg).
    # 9-11    absolute rotation vector (cam)  Absolute orientation of the sphere
    #                                         represented as rotation angle/axis (radians)
    #                                         in camera coordinates.
    # 12-14   absolute rotation vector (lab)  Absolute orientation of the sphere

    #                                         in laboratory coordinates.
    # 15-16   integrated x/y position (lab)   Integrated x/y position (radians) in
    #                                         laboratory coordinates. Scale by sphere
    #                                         radius for true position.
    # 17      integrated animal heading (lab) Integrated heading orientation (radians) of
    #                                         the animal in laboratory coordinates. This
    #                                         is the direction the animal is facing.
    # 18      animal movement direction (lab) Instantaneous running direction (radians) of
    #                                         the animal in laboratory coordinates. This is
    #                                         the direction the animal is moving in the lab
    #                                         frame (add to animal heading to get direction
    #                                         in world).
    # 19      animal movement speed           Instantaneous running speed (radians/frame)
    #                                         of the animal. Scale by sphere radius for
    #                                         true speed.
    # 20-21   integrated forward/side motion  Integrated x/y position (radians) of the

    #                                         heading. Equivalent to the output from two
    #                                         optic mice.
    # 22      timestamp                       Either position in video file (ms) or real
    #                                         capture time for image frame.
    # 23      sequence counter                Position in current frame sequence. Usually
    #                                         corresponds directly to frame counter, but
    #                                         can reset to 1 if tracking is reset.
